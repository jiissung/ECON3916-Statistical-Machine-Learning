# ECON3916-Statistical-Machine-Learning

Economic Data Science Portfolio
Welcome to my digital portfolio for ECON 3916: Statistical & Machine Learning for Economics. This repository showcases my work at the intersection of economic reasoning and modern data-driven methods. As an undergraduate student exploring opportunities in Data Analysis, Economic Consulting, and Finance, I aim to demonstrate how traditional economic theory can be strengthened through computational tools and machine learning techniques.

About This Portfolio
This portfolio documents my progression through a course built on a Concept Extension philosophy—starting from core statistical foundations and extending them into scalable machine learning frameworks.

Throughout the labs and projects here, I focus on integrating:
- Causal inference, which helps us understand why economic outcomes occur
- Predictive analytics, which helps us forecast what is likely to happen next
By combining these perspectives, I’m learning to build models that are both interpretable and high-performing, reflecting the dual priorities of modern empirical economics.

If you’re exploring this repository, thanks for stopping by. I’m excited to continue developing my skills and applying them to real-world economic questions.
