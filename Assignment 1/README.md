The Cost of Living Crisis: A Data-Driven Analysis
The Problem

Traditional measures of inflation, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), are designed to track average household expenditures. However, they often fail to capture the unique spending patterns of specific groups—students, for example, who face higher costs in housing, textbooks, and daily living essentials. This mismatch can obscure the real economic pressures students experience and misinform policy or financial planning.

Methodology

To explore this gap, I combined Python data analysis, API-sourced price data, and classical index theory. Using the Laspeyres Index, I compared the official CPI to a student-focused price index (SPI) that reflects actual student consumption patterns. Key steps included:

Fetching regional and national CPI data via the FRED API.

Normalizing both CPI and SPI series for direct comparison.

Calculating divergences over time and visualizing trends using line charts and heatmaps.

Interpreting results through a lens of economic theory and real-world student expenditures.

Key Findings

My analysis reveals a significant divergence between student costs and national inflation. On average, student living costs have outpaced the official CPI by [X]% over the past decade, highlighting the underestimation of economic pressures on younger populations. Housing, food, and educational expenses contribute disproportionately to this divergence, underscoring the limitations of “average” inflation metrics for targeted financial guidance.

These insights provide a data-driven foundation for policy recommendations, university budgeting, and financial planning tools aimed at alleviating the cost-of-living burden for students.
